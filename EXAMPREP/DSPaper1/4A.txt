4A) Suppose the threaded binary tree is given  
                8
               /   \
             5       12
           /   \     /   \
         3      7  10    15

Insert the elements 4, 9, 11, 13, 16 and 2 in that tree and show all the steps in pictorial form.
Point out one reason for using the threaded binary tree


ans. 
A threaded binary tree is a type of binary tree where some null pointers are replaced with pointers called "threads." These threads make inorder traversal faster and more efficient, without using a stack or recursion.

Initial Tree

        8
       /   \
     5       12
   /   \     /   \
 3      7  10    15


Steps to Insert Elements
1. Insert 4
Traverse to the left subtree of 8 → 5 → 3.
Insert 4 as the right child of 3 (since 3 doesn't have a right child).

        8
       /   \
     5       12
   /   \     /   \
 3      7  10    15
  \
   4


2. Insert 9
Traverse to the right subtree of 8 → 12 → 10.
Insert 9 as the left child of 10 (since 10 doesn't have a left child).

        8
       /   \
     5       12
   /   \     /   \
 3      7  10    15
  \        /
   4      9

3. Insert 11
Traverse to the right subtree of 8 → 12 → 10.
Insert 11 as the right child of 10 (since 10 doesn't have a right child).

          8
       /     \
     5        12
   /   \     /   \
 3      7  10    15
  \        / \
   4      9  11

4. Insert 13
Traverse to the right subtree of 8 → 12 → 15.
Insert 13 as the left child of 15 (since 15 doesn't have a left child).

          8
       /     \
     5        12
   /   \     /   \
 3      7  10    15
  \         / \   /
   4       9  11 13

5. Insert 16
Traverse to the right subtree of 8 → 12 → 15.
Insert 16 as the right child of 15 (since 15 doesn't have a right child).

          8
       /     \
     5        12
   /   \     /   \
 3      7  10    15
  \        / \   / \
   4      9  11 13 16

6. Insert 2
Traverse to the left subtree of 8 → 5 → 3.
Insert 2 as the left child of 3 (since 3 doesn't have a left child).

             8
         /      \
       5        12
     /   \     /   \
   3      7  10    15
 /  \        / \   / \
2    4      9  11 13 16

Final Tree with Inorder Threads
For threaded binary trees, threads are added for null pointers to facilitate inorder traversal. Pointers are created for the next inorder successor where no child exists. For the final tree:
Threads would connect:
2 → 3
4 → 5
7 → 8
11 → 12
13 → 15
16 → (back to the root or NULL).
